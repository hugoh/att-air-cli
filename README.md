# att-air-cli - Command-Line Tool To Manage AT&T Internet Air Gateway

Very early but works to restart WAN connect on BGW530-900.

Code is currently pretty messy. The login code was adapted from [CptMeetKat's OptusDNSBypass JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/CptMeetKat/OptusDNSBypass/tree/f627f7cedb08086786315e8a40a74e63fa6338fb/RouterAPI) and developed with Gen AI's help. Cleanup is planned.
